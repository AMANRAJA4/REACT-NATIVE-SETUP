Environment setup for React native

1. Install Node.js 
link : https://nodejs.org/en/download

2. Install NVM

If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI. 
Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and, while it has many features, the 
most relevant feature for us right now is that it can get you writing a React Native 
app within minutes. You will only need a recent version of Node.js and a phone or emulator. 
If you'd like to try out React Native directly in your web browser before installing 
any tools, you can try out Snack.


3. Install EXPO CLI  

command : [ npm install -g expo-cli ]    [  npm ] 
command : [ yarn global add expo-cli ]   [  yarn ]
version check : [ expo --version ]

Note: Before using yarn you need to install yarn.


4. Install Yarn to install dependencies. (default when yarn.lock exists)
command : [ npm install --global yarn ]
version check : [ yarn --version ]

5. How to create new project.
command : [ expo init YourProjectName ]

6. How to run react native project.
cd AwesomeProject
command : [ npm start / expo start / yarn start]
Note : Always prefer expo start to run your project.

7. Finding issue to run project in vs code.
open powershell as administrater and run command

and Enter [ Y ] when it make permission.
